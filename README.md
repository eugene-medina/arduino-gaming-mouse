Arduino-based gaming pointer mouse using IMU

I have always wondered if the classical mouse can be modified for a more-engaging type of input to be used in fps-style games, as well as simulation-style games. In this project, the objective is to simulate mouse controls using an Arduino and an Inertial Measurement Unit module such as the MPU6050.
